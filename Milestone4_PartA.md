### Communication 1:
The most significant way to have strong communication is through verbal expression. As a result, being able to hear your classmate’s voice in real-time while working together creates a strong partnership. “When talking about the code out loud and articulating it to your partner you are able to find hidden details in the code and can significantly reduce the risk of errors.” (1). We have also considered a text chat for accessibility reasons, as deaf or mute persons would not be able to engage with a voice chat feature.

### Communication 2:
Being able to see what other users are typing in real time can help clarify where work is being done in a file, and by whom. In pair programming, this allows the ‘driver’ to immediately relay their position in the document to ‘observer’ and allows the observer to follow coding closely. This indicator also allows the observing user to look at other parts of the file while not losing their place, as the driver’s position is kept available so long as they are editing the document. “Creativity in a collaborative context, for example, can be aided by activity awareness, whereby each individual is aware of other collaborators’ work and is cognizant of other people’s plans and understandings” (2).

### Live File Sharing 2:
Simultaneous file sharing saves a lot of time and increases efficiency. It is “a way to simplify the management of group- owned repositories” (3) that assists in managing class projects.It ensures that each user is able to look at the same file and be able to contribute to it. It also allows users to be able to download files offline in case they do not have a stable internet connection.
