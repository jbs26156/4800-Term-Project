## B1)

### Research Question:

* Does using our solution improve pair-programming efficiency in a hybrid-synchronous class setting? 

### Methodology:

* Mixed Methods - Observation, Survey, and Interview
* We picked these methods as this would allow for us to observe students utilizing different forms of pair-programming solutions, and then collect both quantitative data from the survey, and qualitative data from the observation and the interview about their experiences with the various pair-programming solutions.


## B2)

In order to test our research question, we intend to send out an email to the UGA CS student listserv. The email will note that we are planning a voluntary observational study. 
Additionally, the participants, who complete the study, have the chance to win one of 50 $10 gift cards. CS students that choose to participate will be placed in a group of 2, and each week they will be assigned a specific pair-programming solution to use to solve a coding problem. The different solutions will be: Zoom, VS Code, and our interface. The students will have a week to work on the problem together. We will continue this process for 3 weeks, so that there is replication and thus more data. Each week, all the students participating in the study will be placed in a large Zoom call and then into their group breakout rooms. Researchers will move around the breakout rooms to monitor that the programmers are using their assigned method. At the end of each week, interviewers will ask the pairs specific questions to measure their efficiency and opinions on their assigned method.

1. Informed consent:
   * The initial email sent will include all pertinent study information, as well as a disclosure that participation is voluntary and an explanation of the possible reward (study incentive).

2. Data collection:
   * We will collect data in three ways, two qualitative and one quantitative. Observation in Zoom breakouts will involve note taking on the part of observers, and interviewers will also take notes during interviews. These notes will be condensed and sorted by frequency of similar notes (e.g. participants found this aspect of the solution counterintuitive). As for quantitative data, surveys will score participant responses and summate scores to provide an approximate rating of the solution software in comparison to traditional hybrid-synchronous pair programming methods.

3. Data analysis:
   * To analyze the data collected during the study, positive sentiment towards a specific software will be weighted against negative sentiment in both the qualitative and quantitative datasets. This will provide a ‘big picture’ view of the data, and can be plotted on a graph to show distribution and left or right leans in the dataset, where a left lean indicates an overall negative sentiment towards the software, and a right lean indicates an overall positive sentiment towards the software. These graphs (as there will be one for each of the three pair-programming methods) can then be overlaid or compared, such that clustering and dataset means show which method was the preferred method of the three.

4. Safe research:
   * Participants will join a Zoom call and be split into breakout rooms for the observational portion of the study. Surveys will be conducted online, and interviews will be held through Zoom. This eliminates any risk of person-to-person contact, and participants can choose to leave their webcams off during any Zoom call during the study.
