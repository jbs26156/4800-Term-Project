## Part B


#### User Story 1: As a programming student, I want to be able to communicate with my classmate so that we can discuss the code.

* **Create a button to mute and unmute yourself in real-time**

</p>

Having a mute/unmute toggle allows users to have control over when they speak to the other user, and can help mitigate background noise. This should help make users more comfortable about speaking as they have total control over their own audio input.


* **Include a chat box at the bottom of the display so that both users can talk with one another.**

</p>

With this wireframe we sought to produce a design that would allow users a more passive option for communication, that was centered around real-time messaging rather than any type of live voice or video. This option was created under the assumption that users may want an option that can be recorded and referenced over time.


#### User Story 2: As a programming student, I want to be able to see what my classmate is typing so that I can follow along and comment on what they are doing.

* **Create a notification to see when someone makes an update**

</p>

This lets users know when the other active user makes a change, where the change was made, and what the change entailed. This helps users stay aware of file changes in real-time.


* **Have an indicator showing where the other user(s) are typing**

</p>

We should show where users are typing and who wrote what so that the users can know what is new to the code. Having a highlight above where a user is typing is a good idea so users know who wrote what and where.  It is also a good idea to include a changelog so users can easily go back and look at changes if they need to get rid of something.


#### UserStory 3: As a programming student, I want my coding partner and I to have access to the same file so that we can work on it simultaneously on different devices.

* **Show the file directory in a tree on the side of the interface** 
<p align="center">

</p>

Having a file tree on the side of the interface is essential so users know what file they are working in and where that file is located in terms of the entire directory. Having it in the tree format is a good way to visualize it as people are typically already comfortable with this layout. Having the subdirectories right and below the directories shows the hierarchy in a clear manner. 


* **Show the files in your current working directory**

</p>

This alternate design for this user story presented a more traditional design of displaying the present working directory rather than a type of tree-directory structure. This design is familiar to many users who code via terminals and other similar applications, and as well as a user who is used to file browsers in most operating systems.
