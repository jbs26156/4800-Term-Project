## Part C

### C1) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom creates limitations/ inability to utilize pair programming in college curriculum during hybrid synchronous classes. In previous semesters, we would use Zoom to share screens and Github to share code. There are other applications like Visual Studio’s “Live Share”, but most students did not know of such options. Even with the existence of these third party applications, they still lack certain capabilities that were previously present during in-person pair programming. Some of these issues include: lack of intuitive use, asynchronous collaboration, inability to share links, one-user session hosting, and lack of easy file sharing. A way to resolve such problems would be to create/find a software that allows real time coding collaboration. This software would allow users to be able to both see what is being typed and to make changes simultaneously so they can effectively work in pairs, as well as allowing them to communicate over audio. This will allow users to practice “pair programming” and debug in real time. Additionally, users should be able to share resources and talk to one another  while they are coding. Our proposed software will include buttons and a visually appealing, yet simple display. This will resolve the issue that new programmers have with using new software. Intuitive usability is extremely important, especially when coding, because it greatly diminishes the learning curve. As a result, this increases the popularity of the software. Likewise, the interface is less likely to alienate certain users, especially novice users. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to share resources such as helpful tutorials or documentation is essential when pair programming, because it allows users to be able to search the internet for ideas and help and allows them to share with their partner(s). This is one feature that zoom coding does allow as it has a chat function, however we think that this can be improved upon. By adding a specific link sharing part into the software, we can include a link preview which will help the users see what the page looks like before they go to it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One solution that we found online is Visual Studio Code’s “live share extension”. The extension was complicated to set up, had an overall lack of signifiers, and was clearly an extension tacked onto an already existing piece of software. 

### C2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ultimate goal is to measure whether remote pair programming in a hybrid synchronous learning environment is done effectively. To see if our conditions are met, we would ideally have students complete a survey afterward completing the programming assignment. The survey would include various questions to measure how the user’s experience with the software was. An example survey question could include:  “While completing your code using the software, did you find the interface easy to navigate?” Due to the fact that the result of this survey is subjective in nature, each user’s response will determine whether the solution was a success or not. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn the subjective responses from the survey into quantitative values, each answer choice from the survey will be assigned a value. For instance, if the options are: agree, disagree, strongly agree, strongly disagree, or unsure, each option will be given a score of -2 to 2. At the end of the survey, each person is assigned a score equal to the sum of their answers. Afterwards, we can measure success by comparing each person’s score (higher scores equate to positive response and vice versa). Moreover, if the majority of scores are negative,  this will show us what aspects of our solution need to be improved upon based on the survey responses.
