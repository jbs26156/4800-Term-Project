## Part C

### C1) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom is limiting and makes it hard to fully utilize pair programming in college curriculum during hybrid synchronous classes. In previous semesters, we would use Zoom to share screens and Github to share code [C1:1]. There are other applications like Visual Studio’s “Live Share”, but these are rarely brought to the attention of students. Even with the existence of such third party applications, each still lacks certain capabilities that were present during in-person classes before the hybrid synchronous model. Some of these issues include: lack of intuitive use, asynchronous collaboration, one-user session hosting, and lack of easy file sharing. A way to resolve such problems would be to create or find a software that allows real time coding collaboration. This software would allow users to be able to both see what is being typed and make changes to files as well as allowing them to communicate over audio, so that users can work in pairs effectively. This will allow students to practice pair programming and debugging in real time. Our proposed software will afford: 
 * coding — users can edit open files in a text field that takes up the main application window; 
 * communication — a voice chat and text chat will allow users to talk with one-another while working, a vital facet of pair programming; 
 * file sharing — files will be stored on the cloud and available for download onto a local machine, so all users have an up-to-date version of the file available at all times. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will be accompanied by signifiers (buttons and graphics designed to be easy to understand) that help users intuitively use the software. This should help eliminate the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation, as users will know what they are doing, have an easy time doing it, and understand how their pair programming session went after it ends. Intuitive usability is extremely important, especially when coding, because it distracts users and takes away time from coding. By having good usability, the interface is less likely to alienate users — especially novice ones. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to share resources such as helpful tutorials or documentation is essential when pair programming, because it allows users to be able to search the internet for ideas and help and allows them to share these with their partner(s). This is one feature that Zoom does allow, as it has a chat function. However we think that this can be improved.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One solution that we found online is Visual Studio Code’s Live Share extension. The extension was complicated to set up, had an overall lack of signifiers, and was clearly an extension tacked onto an already existing piece of software.

### C2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ultimate goal is to measure whether remote pair programming in a hybrid synchronous learning environment is done effectively. To see if our conditions are met, we would ideally have students complete a survey afterward completing the programming assignment. The survey would include various questions to measure how the user’s experience with the software was. An example survey question could be “While completing your code using the software, did you find the interface beneficial to your progress?” 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the fact that the result of this survey is subjective in nature, each user’s response will determine whether the solution was a success or not. To turn the subjective responses from the survey into quantitative values, each answer choice from the survey will be assigned a value. For instance, if the options are: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, or strongly agree, each option will be given a score of -2 to 2. At the end of the survey, each person is assigned a score equal to the sum of their answers. Using this score, we can measure success by comparing each person’s sum, where higher scores showing users preferred the solution software and lower scores showing users preferred the control software. Though the overall score is important, individual responses to questions will also help target areas with room for improvement. If the majority of scores on a specific question are negative, this will show us what specific aspects of our solution need to be improved based on the survey responses.
