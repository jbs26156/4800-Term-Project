## Welcome to Piazza Hut

Hybrid synchronous learning limits active learning for students. This is an issue for students, not so much for the teachers. Pair programming is difficult for partners with one in-person and one online or if both are online. Pair programming and active learning have been crucial tools for students in the computer science department before going virtual. This idea has been lost for students attending hybrid synchronous classes. Thus, the inability of this opportunity removes the benefits of live feedback.
