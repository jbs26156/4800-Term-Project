## Part A

### A1) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant problem due to hybrid synchronous learning in Computer Science classes is the lack of efficient pair programming. Since pair programming is a crucial part of early foundational computer science courses, we find it imperative that students have the opportunity to easily collaborate on code, even in a hybrid-asynchronous environment. If both students in a hybrid course are online, or if one is online and one is in-person, it becomes extremely hard to pair program in an IDE or text editor. Researchers at The University of Florida conducted a research study that examined pairs of students who completed assignments either through, pair programming in person or through a hybrid pair programming solution where the students completed the same assignment side-by-side but with separate code bases.[A1:1] The researchers deemed that the learning score was relatively similar. [A1:1] However, the lower satisfaction score of the students in the hybrid section was deemed statistically significant in comparison to the in-person pair-programming. [A1:1]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few options on combating such difficulties. For instance, users can share screens on zoom, but the spectator must copy the active coder’s work. Users could instead have to push and pull from GitHub to have access to the same files, which can in-and-of-itself introduce issues to novice programmers. As a result, it slows down the pair programming process during the ‘handoff’ process since the code sent to a partner is reliant on GitHub push/pull requests speed and the user’s experience with GitHub.


Pair Programming and the Seven Stages of Action
 * Goal: Students collaborate by pair programming to reach a solution for their instructional assignment given in class.  
 
 * Plan: Students must decide if collaborating via sharing screens or working on a joint GitHub project will be more efficient.
 
 * Specify: Students communicate their plans and decide which method of collaboration is best.
	
 * Perform: Students either share screens in a zoom breakout room or create a shared GitHub repository.
	
 * Perceive: By working together on this interface they were able to solve the coding problem.

 * Interpret: Once done pair programming, the users can decide whether they were successful.  
	
 * Compare: Your goal and task are not the same. The user’s goal is to successfully solve a given coding assignment. Their task is to agree on the interface platform to share their code on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affected users of this problem are university students who take a coding class in a hybrid synchronous setting. These students are often required to complete assignments that rely on pair programming. Students in programming classes at the university level are often expected to be able to program in pairs or in small teams. This is an important skill that students learn to then utilize in the workforce. “Advocates of this method assert that paired programmers catch and address more errors, improve their programming approaches, produce better code due to collaborative cognitive efforts, and are more satisfied with the process”[A2:1].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented effective pair programming due to the lack of opportunities to meet in person. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, pair programming is an essential skill that every computer science student must learn in programming classes. Thus, users would benefit greatly on a solution to the problem of effective remote pair programming.
