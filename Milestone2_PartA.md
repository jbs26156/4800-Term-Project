## Part A

### A1) 
   Within the theme of hybrid-asynchronous classes, we decided an important problem in the space is how active learning, more specifically pair programming, was impacted by the shift to online course attendance. Since pair programming is a crucial part of early foundational computer science courses, we find it imperative that students have the opportunity to easily collaborate on code even in a hybrid-asynchronous environment. If both students in a hybrid course are online, or if one is online and one is in-person, it becomes extremely hard to pair program in an IDE or text editor. Users must either share screens, and the spectator must copy the active coder’s work. Or the two users have to push and pull from GitHub to have access to the same files, which can introduce issues in-and-of-itself to novice programmers. As a result, it slows down the pair programming process during the ‘handoff’ process since the code sent to a partner is reliant on GitHub push/pull requests speed. 

Pair Programming and the Seven Stages of Action
 * Goal: Students collaborate by pair programming to reach a solution for their instructional assignment given in class. 

* Plan: Students must decide if collaborating via sharing screens or working on a joint GitHub project will be more efficient.
* Specify: Students communicate their plans and decide which method of collaboration is best.
	
* Perform: Students either share screens in a zoom breakout room or create a shared GitHub repository.
	
* Perceive: By working together on this interface they were able to solve the coding problem.

* Interpret: Once done pair programming, the users can decide whether they were successful. 
	
* Compare: Your goal and task are not the same. The user’s goal is to successfully solve a given coding assignment. Their task is to agree on the interface platform to share their code on. 

### A2)
 Potential users are university students who are in hybrid synchronous programming classes. They are often required to complete assignments that rely on pair programming. Students in programming classes at the university level are often expected to be able to program in pairs or in small teams. This is an important skill that students learn that is then utilized in the workforce. Programming with a fellow coder helps prevent “coder's block” and increase creativity. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented effective pair programming due to the lack of opportunities to meet in person. Pair programming is an essential skill that every computer science student must learn in programming classes. Thus, users would benefit greatly on a solution to the problem of effective remote pair programming.
