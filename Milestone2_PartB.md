## Milestone 2 Part B

### B1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of Pair Programming is nothing new. Throughout the development of the computer age, companies have introduced multiple applications softwares to help programmers collaborate. GitHub, for instance, is a household name among programmers. GitHub, for instance, is a website with over fifty five million users and more than one hundred ninety million repositories [B1:1]. There is no doubt that GitHub is a popular tool in the computer science field. The biggest benefit of GitHub is the ease of concurrent coding. Unfortunately, the website has a steep learning curve for novice users. In general, new computer science students who are asked to pair program have little, if any, experience using GitHub. This makes what should be an easy collaborative assignment unnecessarily difficult. GitHub was not designed to solve the specific issue of Pair Programming. It is an internet host designed to help store software development; there is no live programming component, at least as of yet. At its core, the website is a project management software tool that users can utilize to save and share code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, another option is to use Zoom’s screen share and remote control feature. The benefit of using Zoom with one person controlling the screen is that it allows another student to watch in real-time and give direct feedback. However, the application tends to have horrendous lag and network issues while this feature is enabled. Additionally, time is wasted during unexpected pauses in service and server wide outages affecting millions of users, like the outage reported by zoom on it’s status page on Monday August 24th, 2020 [B1:2]. Consequently, the observing student might not be able to see what is being typed, and or the remote controlling student may have connectivity issues controlling the desktop of the host student, thus leading to confusion and frustration by all parties involved.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest solution to a peer programming application our group discovered was Visual Studio’s Live Share extension. This extension allows multiple users to use the same Visual Studio IDE simultaneously; it even comes with a built-in voice chat feature [B1:3]. Unfortunately, the Visual Studios Live Share extension is not ideal as it has several shortcomings which make it difficult to use in our problem’s context. For instance, users must be familiar with the Visual Studio interface and the user with the project files must be online for others to have editing privileges. So, though it remedies one problem, it goes onto create multiple others.

**Guidelines:**
* Practice Universal Design: Github was built to be accessible by all users, given enough time to learn the platform. Zoom also has accessible features, allowing users to turn their microphones and cameras on and off, as well as hotkeys for app functions. The ability to share screens in a call makes pair programming with Zoom possible.
* Create Accessible Documents: Github allows for users to use their insite editor to view files of any compatible file type without leaving the site. Zoom, however it is not easy for all documents to be easily accessed during the duration of a call or meeting. Documents can be uploaded to the chat, but file upload/download speeds and file size dictate how fast users can share their work

**Principles:**
* Permit easy reversal of actions. Github has many built in ways to go back or revert to previously working code. One way to do this is to use the revert command. Another way to do this is to check out a previous push that worked correctly. With zoom coding, the user who is typing could hit “control-z” in whatever external IDE or text editor they are coding in.  
* Offer informative feedback. When pair programming with github, when an issue occurs within github, github will try and explain what the issue is. If one has a decent knowledge of github jargon, it can be useful. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of knowledge of github to be able to do this.
