## Milestone 2 Part B

### B1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A website with 14 million users and 35 million projects (April 2016), there is no doubt that GitHub is a popular tool in the computer science field. An existing solution is using github to pair program. One pro of using github can be the ease of concurrently coding. One major con of github is that it has a steep learning curve to be able to use it well. Generally, students who are asked to pair program are new to computer science and usually have little, if any, experience using github. This makes what should be an easy collaborative assignment unnecessarily hard. Additionally, another issue relates to using zoom, specifically having one student control the screen and having the other student give input. The benefit of using zoom with one student controlling the screen is that it allows another student to watch a student code and give input. However, a major con of this deals with the frequent network issues on zoom. Additionally, the observing student might not be able to clearly see what is being typed if the resolution is not perfect. Another shortcoming of this is that the observing student might not feel as if they are contributing. Github was not also designed with the intention of solving pair-programming, and even though it is used to that extent it is at its core a project management software.

**Guidelines:**
* Practice Universal Design. Github was built to be accessible by all users, given enough time to learn the platform. Zoom also has accessible features, allowing users to turn their microphones and cameras on and off, as well as hotkeys for app functions. The ability to share screens in a call makes pair programming with Zoom possible.
* Create Accessible Documents: Github allows for users to use their insite editor to view files of any compatible file type without leaving the site. Zoom, however it is not easy for all documents to be easily accessed during the duration of a call or meeting.

**Principles:**
* Permit easy reversal of actions. Github has many built in ways to go back or revert to previously working code. One way to do this is to use the revert command. Another way to do this is to check out a previous push that worked correctly. With zoom coding, the user who is typing could hit “control-z”. 
* Offer informative feedback. When pair programming with github, when an issue occurs within github, github will try and explain what the issue is. If one has a decent knowledge of github jargon, it can be useful. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of knowledge of github to be able to do this.
