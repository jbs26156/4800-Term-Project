## Part A

### A1) 
#### Coding

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. As a programming student, I want live error checking on my code so that there are less bugs and errors. 

#### Communication

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. As a programming student, I want to be able to communicate with my classmates so that we can discuss the code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As a programming student, I want to be able to see what my classmate is typing so that I can follow along and comment on what they are doing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As a programming student, I want to be able to collaborate with my classmates so that we can share ideas, work as a team, and learn from each other.

#### Live File Sharing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. As a programming student, I want to have access to files so that I can view my work at any time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As a programming student, I want my coding partner and I to have access to the same file so that we can work on it simultaneously on different devices.

### A2) 
There are three user stories in section A1 that we find most relevant to our proposed solution: Communication 1, Communication 2, and Live File Sharing 2.

#### Communication 1:
The most significant way to  have strong communication is through verbal expression. As a result, being able to hear your classmate’s voice in real-time while working together creates a strong partnership. “When talking about the code out loud and articulating it to your partner you are able to find hidden details in the code and can significantly reduce the risk of errors.” (1). We have also considered a text chat for accessibility reasons, as deaf or mute persons would not be able to engage with a voice chat feature.

#### Communication 2:
Being able to see what other users are typing in real time can help clarify where work is being done in a file, and by whom. In pair programming, this allows the ‘driver’ to immediately relay their position in the document to ‘observer’ and allows the observer to follow coding closely. This indicator also allows the observing user to look at other parts of the file while not losing their place, as the driver’s position is kept available so long as they are editing the document. “Creativity in a collaborative context, for example, can be aided by activity awareness, whereby each individual is aware of other collaborators’ work and is cognizant of other people’s plans and understandings” (2).

#### Live File Sharing 2:
Simultaneous file sharing saves a lot of time and increases efficiency. It is “a way to simplify the management of group- owned repositories” (3) that assists in managing class projects.It ensures that each user is able to look at the same file and be able to contribute to it. It also allows users to be able to download files offline in case they do not have a stable internet connection.
